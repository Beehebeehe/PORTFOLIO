                <h2>Hi there!,</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Abeeha Shaikh,a dedicated and passionate computer science student who finds immense joy in exploring the 
                    world of technology. My journey in the field of computer science has been incredibly fun and fulfilling, and I am particularly drawn to cybersecurity, 
                    where I aim to deepen my knowledge and expertise. I see every challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, which fuels my
                    enthusiasm for constantly seeking new learning opportunities. Alongside my studies, I enjoy expressing my creativity through 
                    journaling and vlogging, activities that allow me to reflect and share my thoughts with others. In my downtime,
                     I love watching series, especially K-dramas, as they offer a wonderful escape while providing cultural insights.
                    Currently, I am focused on expanding my skill set, particularly in coding. I am working on various beginner-level projects 
                    to strengthen my foundation in HTML and other web development technologies. My goal is to become proficient in web development 
                    and ultimately use those skills to contribute to the tech community. I believe in the power of self-improvement, which is why
                    I’m always eager to try new things, whether it's mastering a new programming language or exploring different aspects of the tech world.
                    With a balance of professionalism and approachability, I am always looking for ways to merge my personal growth with my passion for 
                    technology, and I am excited for the endless possibilities that lie ahead.

                <p> My parents are truly my role models.
                     They've sacrificed so much to provide me with everything I could need or want, demonstrating a level of selflessness and dedication that I deeply admire. I often wonder if I could ever be even a quarter as selfless and committed as they are, and their example constantly inspires me to be a better person.</p>

            <h2>VISION FOR THE FUTURE</h2>
            <p>In ten years’ I hope to be a professional working in the area of cybersecurity having mastered the skills that enable me to perform functions such as protecting digital assets and assisting in preventing organizations from new forms of cyber-attacks. In relation to career goals I plan to pursue some higher certificates and knowledge, firstly be an expert cybersecurity professional in the field and secondly develop new ideas to improve the overall security of people’s data around the globe. Personally, I plan to keep an agile life where I perform my work well and at the same time pursue other creative functions such as journaling and vlogging. I would consider myself a student and would like to constantly work on my coding skills and other new interesting technologies.</p>
